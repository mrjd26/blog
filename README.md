Literally writing my firstComponent in React...

just getting import, export syntax down


I've been thinking about just throwing out the whole toolchain exploration thing...


React kind of makes sense to learn because instead of document.createElement all over the place, I just write JSX ( * some giant chunk of HTML * )

It's kind of neat because I can then, in turn,  "escape" escape the HTML with curly braces to write JS {}

I don't like how React is kind of verbose and repetitive though, e.g. passing onClick methods through React components and their functions and classes and props.  the traceback, I would imagine would get confusing.
